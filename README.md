📖 Project Overview

The Travel and Tourism Management System is a software application developed to simplify the management of travel-related services such as tour packages, destinations, bookings, customers, and feedback.

The system provides:

A User Module for customers to browse and book tour packages.

An Admin Module for travel agencies to manage packages, bookings, pricing, and customer data.

The project follows a layered architecture and integrates industry-standard tools like Apache Maven for build automation and GitHub for version control.

❗ Problem Statement

Traditional travel booking systems rely heavily on manual processes such as paperwork, phone calls, and physical visits. These methods are:

Time-consuming

Error-prone

Difficult to manage

Lacking transparency

This project aims to eliminate these drawbacks by providing a centralized, automated travel management system.

🎯 Objectives

Automate travel booking and management operations

Provide a centralized database for travel data

Reduce human errors and paperwork

Improve customer experience

Ensure secure data storage using MySQL

Implement Maven for structured project management

Use GitHub for version control and collaboration

🏗 System Architecture

The system follows a Three-Tier Architecture:

Presentation Layer

Handles user/admin interaction (Console or GUI)

Business Logic Layer

Processes bookings, validations, and rules

Data Access Layer

Handles database operations using JDBC
